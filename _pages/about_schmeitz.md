## Ruben Schmeitz

Ruben Schmeitz is pursuing his PhD in the Mechanics of Materials (MoM) group, 
led by Joris Remmers, at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). His research 
is at the crossroads of machine learning and mechanical engineering, with a 
particular emphasis on 3D printing. Under the supervision of Joris Remmers, 
with support from Olga Mula and Rob Wolfs, he aims to enhance 3D printing 
processes. His work is part of the CTRL-P: Compute-Train-Learn 3D Printing 
project within the Department of Mechanical Engineering. This project is a 
part of EMDAIR (Exploratory Multidisciplinary AI Research), a program 
initiated by EAISI (Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence Systems Institute).
