## Britt Cordewener

Britt Cordewener is a Doctoral Candidate in the Mechanics of Materials 
(MoM) group of Joris Remmers. Her PhD research is focused on the 
Additive Manufacturing of lightweight embedded electronics. Combining 
Additive Manufacturing (AM) with Direct Write (DW) technologies such 
as Laser Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) allows for the production of 
objects with embedded electronics and conductive tracks. As a part of 
the LEE-BED project, together with TNO and Holst Center, a 3D Multi 
Material printing (3DMM) pilot line will be developed. Britt is 
researching the thermo-mechanical properties of the printed, conductive 
tracks and the interfaces between the printed tracks, the substrate and 
the electronic components to achieve optimal conductivity, printability 
and performance of the embedded electronics.
